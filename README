WAVE MIXER
Ankit Kotak (201202102)

This application allows us to take 3 input files and for each .wav audio file, we can do:
	- Amplitude Scaling (0-5 units)
	- Time reversal
	- Time scaling (0-8 units) 
	- Time shifting (-1 to 1 sec)

After doing these operations, we can play the resulting file using the 'Play' icon below it, Pause the file using
the 'Pause' icon.

Also we can select multiple files for Mixing or Modulation using the 'Select for Mixing' and 'Select for Modulation' checkboxes and
then Play/Pause/Stop using options under 'Mix and Play' and 'Modulate and Play'.

Also a 'Record Audio' option is also there. Audio can be recorded using 'Record' icon.You can Play the recording using the play button.     

The GUI and AUDIO files are done using PyAudio and Tkinter.
